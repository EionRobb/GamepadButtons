# Gamepad buttons plugin for Cordova/PhoneGap #

By [Vlad Stirbu](https://github.com/vstirbu).

This plugin allows you to use the buttons of Android gamepads in Cordova/PhoneGap applications.

## Adding the plugin to your project ##

1. Create a folder called 'com/vladstirbu/cordova/' within your project's src folder.
2. Copy the GamepadButtons.java into this new folder.
3. In your 'res/xml/config.xml' file add the following line:

	`<plugin name="GamepadButtons" value="com.vladstirbu.cordova.GamepadButtons" onload="true" />`
	
## Using the plugin ##

The plugin emits a ```gamepad.{buttonCode}``` event when a button is pressed. The 'buttonCode' values are standard Android key code [constants](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/KeyEvent.html).

```javascript
document.addEventListener('gamepad.KEYCODE_BUTTON_L1', function() {console.log('L1');}, false);
```
